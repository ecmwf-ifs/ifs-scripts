# Integrated Forecast System (IFS) Scripts

This repository contains a subset of the scripts for ECMWF's Integrated
Forecast System (IFS).

The subset available here under an Apache 2 licence consists of *only those
script files that have already been agreed for release, under the same
licence*.

As such it is much reduced and serves only as a reference. Some files might
already be available in other repositories, but are reproduced here in one
place, and in context in the original IFS directory structure, and replicating
the original IFS branching/versioning.

Use outside of ECMWF is not supported.
